# Overview

The employee development system I developed serves as a learning tool for understanding and applying C# programming concepts. It presents additional, editing and displayment of employees by the user.

The primary purpose of creating this software was to deepen my knowledge of the C# programming language and reinforce my understanding of fundamental concepts. By building employee development system, I aimed to gain practical experience in working with conditional statements, loops, data structures, and user input handling. The project allowed me to apply these concepts in a fun and engaging way, enhancing my problem-solving skills and programming proficiency.

# Development Environment

I create employee development system using the C# programming language, which allowed me to demonstrate my skills and understanding of C# syntax and principles. To build and test the software, I used Visual Studio, a robust integrated development environment (IDE) for C# development. This IDE provided a wide range of tools, including a code editor, debugger, and project management features.
